title: About
---

I am a developer (ex-researcher) interested in everything but mostly:
- formal software engineering: whatever makes computers more robust.
- multipath networking: think TRILL, LISP, Multipath TCP (multipath QUIC ?)

Contributor of neovim, I love nixos and currently trying to make data analysis more approachable in haskell.
